# 🗂️ Leave Management System (C# Windows Forms - Admin & Employee Applications)

A desktop-based **Leave Management System** built using **C# and Windows Forms**, featuring two separate applications for **Admins** and **Employees**. This system allows employees to request leaves and administrators to manage and approve/reject those requests efficiently.

## 📝 Description

The Leave Management System is designed to streamline the leave application and approval process within an organization. The solution is split into two standalone Windows Forms applications:

- **Employee Application:** Allows employees to log in, submit leave requests, view leave status, and track their leave balance.
- **Admin Application:** Enables admins to manage employee data, review leave requests, approve or reject them, and generate leave reports.

It provides a user-friendly interface, basic authentication, and centralized data storage via a SQL-based database.
